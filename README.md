Hello, my name is √çtalo Moreira, Brazilian and chemical engineer.

I've been a developer for over 5 years and I started my career using VBA and then I went through several languages such as Java with a focus on mobile development  and Python for optimization and data science.

Nowadays I maintain a study focused on the mathematical/computational area for project optimization.

As a portfolio, I have projects from application development to a shortest path project similar to Google Maps.

Thank you for your attention and see you soon.
